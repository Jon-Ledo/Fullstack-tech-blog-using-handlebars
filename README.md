## Description

A blog site setup where developers and other tech savvy people can publish their blog posts and comment on other users' posts as well.

Deployed to Heroku, it follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using [express-handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars) as the templating language, [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) as the ORM, and the [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) npm package for authentication.
